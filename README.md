1. Ensure that the microphone access is granted for your code editor to access <br>
2. Download required packages in conda environment <br>
3. For Zero-shot learning, run flask-app_zs.py <br>
4. For One-shot learning, run flask-app_os.py <br>

We have three different python scripts as each app runs on a different port (made the interviews and demos evaluation easier)
